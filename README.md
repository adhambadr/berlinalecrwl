# berlinalecrwl

a selenium based crawler to "freeze" a ticket for you in Berlinale 2017 for 15 mins. 
Tickets go on sale at 10:00 am everyday, a cron job and you'll secure your ticket till 10:15

I built it out of frustration of being a not so well connected filmmaker trying to get some tickets, considerate usage is requested.
